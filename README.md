# Reactive Chocolate
### about creating reactive software


This repo contains a Java (Kotlin!) server application and an HTML client to demonstrate the usage of
* async programming with Futures and CompletableFutures
* RxObservables ([RxJava](http://reactivex.io/))
* Rx-ified API of Vert.x (`io.vertx.rxjava.*`)
* (Project Reactor, Flux API of JDK 9)

Here is [my presentation](https://slides.com/robbosman/reactive#/) that goes along with the code.
